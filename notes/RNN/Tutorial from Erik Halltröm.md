It is short for “Recurrent Neural Network”, and is basically a neural network that can be used when your data is treated as a sequence, where the particular order of the data-points matter. 
More importantly, this sequence can be of arbitrary length.


We will build a simple Echo-RNN that remembers the input data and then echoes it after a few time-steps.
