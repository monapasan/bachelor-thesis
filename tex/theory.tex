\paragraph{Why Neural Networks?}
The problem that we trying to solve in this paper is known as
pattern recognition problem. The problem can be described
as searching for patterns in data like image, text, sound and etc. An example
of the problem can be to find a tree in a picture.
Artifical Neural networks have recently shown good performance and accuracy at recognizing
objects \cite{Krizhevsky2012}.

\paragraph{What is Neural Network?}
Artificial Neural Network(ANN), often referred just as Neural Network(NN),
is in simply words a computational model, which was inspired by how human/animal
brain works. Artificial NN is modeled after the neuronal structure if the brain's
cortex\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Though the inspiration was from the brain,
it's indeed much much simpler than brain in terms of number of neurons that is used
in ANN.
